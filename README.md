M04 Tutorial - Django Introduction - SDEV 220 - Spring 2023 - Developer: T. Barlow - Professor C. Francis

This project is the Django Introduction Tutorial for SDEV 220.  I was able to follow the tutorial and create a system with an Admin Login.  Django is coded with Python, so Python will be the main programming language.  SQLite is the imported Database, the project runs in a virtual environment and includes a blog.

Bug Report:
There were issues installing Django, but those issues were resolved when I carefully went through the instructions, where I noticed lines of code that I missed adding to the Commmand Window.  Overall, the project appears to run with no errors. ~T. Barlow | SDEV 220 Spring 2023 Student | Professor C. Francis
